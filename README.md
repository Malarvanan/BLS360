## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **BLS360**! This repository serves as a collaborative space for SailPoint IdentityIQ developers to share their work, track ongoing tasks, and follow best practices for SailPoint development. By contributing to this repository, you will help create a shared knowledge base, making future IdentityIQ development more efficient and streamlined.

## 📌 Project Scope

- **Task Sharing** 📂: Upload and manage IdentityIQ tasks, such as rules, workflows, and report generation.
- **Code Sharing** 💻: Share reusable code snippets, connectors, and SailPoint-specific customizations.
- **Documentation** 📝: Record solutions for common issues and provide detailed explanations for complex SailPoint development topics.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/BLS360.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd BLS360
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable, e.g., using Maven):
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

## 📏 Usage Guidelines

- **Branching** 🌿: Create a new branch for each task or feature. Branch names should be descriptive and follow the format:
  - `feature/<task-name>` (e.g., `feature/entitlement-report`)
  - `bugfix/<bug-name>` (e.g., `bugfix/correlation-issue`)
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/entitlement-report
  ```

- **Commit Messages** 📝: Use clear, concise commit messages with a description of what was changed. Follow the format:
  - `[Task ID] - <short description>` (e.g., `[T123] - Added entitlement correlation logic`).

  Example:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "[T123] - Fixed entitlement aggregation bug"
  ```

- **Code Review** 🔍: Open a pull request when your task is complete. Be sure to include a description of what changes have been made and tag the relevant team members for review.

- **docs/**: Documentation, including coding standards, best practices, and templates for task documentation.

## 🏗️ Code Structure & Naming Conventions

To ensure consistency and maintainability, please follow these guidelines when writing or contributing to SailPoint IdentityIQ code:

### 1. **Naming Conventions**
   - **Java Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names. For example:
     - `AccountCorrelationRule`
     - `ProvisioningTask`
   - **Methods**: Use camelCase for method names, and ensure methods are action-oriented:
     - `getIdentityData()`
     - `processEntitlements()`
   - **Variables**: Use camelCase for variable names, starting with a lowercase letter:
     - `accountList`
     - `userIdentity`
   - **Constants**: Use uppercase with underscores for constants:
     - `MAX_ENTITLEMENTS`
   - **Files and Directories**: Use lowercase with hyphens to separate words:
     - `account-correlation-rule.java`
     - `user-report-generation.xml`

### 2. **Code Structure**
   - **Custom Rules** 🛠️: Place rules in their dedicated directory under `/tasks`. Ensure that rules are modular and follow the principle of single responsibility.
   - **Error Handling** 🚨: Use try-catch blocks where necessary, and always log errors to ensure traceability.
   - **Configuration Files** 📑: Store SailPoint configuration files (e.g., XML, JSON) under `/config`. Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files wherever possible.
   - **Reusable Components** 🔄: If a piece of logic or function is used in multiple places, consider creating a utility class (e.g., `Utils.java`).

### 3. **JavaDocs and Documentation**
   - All classes, methods, and functions should have proper JavaDocs.
   - Include a brief description of the function's purpose and any important parameters or return values.
   - Refer to the official SailPoint JavaDocs for additional context and examples:  
     [SailPoint IIQ JavaDocs](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/rules/java-docs/)
